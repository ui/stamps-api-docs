B. Generic Response
---------------------

The various order status API calls return responses with similar fields.

Hence, its differences will be highlighted instead in `C. Specific Responses`_.

In response to these API calls, Omni will reply with the following data in JSON:

=================== ==================
Variable            Description
=================== ==================
id                  Order ID
number              Order number string
total               Total value before tax, service charge, delivery fee, discount and promotion
tax                 Tax value
serviceCharge       Service charge
grandTotal          Total value after tax, service charge, delivery fee, discount and promotion
tableNumber         Table number string
channel             An int representing where order was created (Mobile App, POS, Kiosk, Web)
notes               Customer notes string (example: no lettuce)
status              An int representing the order status ID
deliveryStatus      An int representing the delivery status ID
statusText          Order status string
storeName           Store name string
userID              ID of user making the order
created             Time when order is created in UNIX time
paymentMethod       An int representing the payment method ID
paymentStatus       An int representing the payment status ID
user                Contains the user's id, name and phone number
delivery_info       null
=================== ==================

Depending on the request, responses may return these status codes:

=================== ==============================
Code                Description
=================== ==============================
200                 Everything worked as expected
400                 Bad Request, usually missing a required parameter
401                 Unauthorized, usually missing or wrong authentication token
403                 Forbidden â€“ You do not have permission for this request
405                 HTTP method not allowed
500, 502, 503, 504  Something went wrong on Omni's end
=================== ==============================


Here are examples of API responses:


If call to order status API is successful (JSON):

.. code-block:: bash

    HTTP/1.0 200 OK
    Vary: Accept
    Content-Type: application/json
    Allow: POST, OPTIONS
    [Redacted Header]

    {
        "id": 1,
        "number": "FR9TL74P",
        "total": 36364.0,
        "tax": 3636.0,
        "serviceCharge": 0.0,
        "grandTotal": 40000.0,
        "tableNumber": "A1",
        "channel": 2,
        "notes": "No lettuce",
        "status": 10,
        "deliveryStatus": 10,
        "statusText": "Confirmed",
        "storeName": "Burger God",
        "userID": 1,
        "created": 1564045835,
        "paymentMethod": 1,
        "paymentStatus": 1,
        "user": {
            "id": 1,
            "name": "user",
            "phone": "+628111111111"
        },
        "delivery_info": null
    }

When some fields don't validate (JSON):

.. code-block:: bash

    HTTP/1.0 400 BAD REQUEST
    Vary: Accept
    Content-Type: application/json
    Allow: POST, OPTIONS
    [Redacted Header]

    {
        "error_message": "Order not found",
        "error_code": "invalid_order_number",
        "errors": {
            "number": "Order not found"
        }
    }

If missing or wrong authentication token:

.. code-block:: bash

    HTTP/1.0 401 UNAUTHORIZED
    Vary: Accept
    Content-Type: application/json
    Allow: POST, OPTIONS
    [Redacted Header]
    
    {"detail": "Invalid token"}

If HTTP is used instead of HTTPS:

.. code-block:: bash

    HTTP/1.0 403 FORBIDDEN
    Vary: Accept
    Content-Type: application/json
    Allow: POST, OPTIONS
    [Redacted Header]

    {"detail": "Please use https instead of http"}


C. Specific Responses
-----------------------

These are the specific behaviors and responses caused by specific API calls


Confirm Order Response
_______________________

Confirm Order changes the :code:`"status"` field from 1 (new) to 10 (confirmed) and the :code:`"statusText"` from "New" to "Confirmed".

If an order is already confirmed, complete, or cancelled, the API call will return an error response stating that.


Paid Order Response
_______________________

Paid Order changes the :code:`"paymentStatus"` field from 1 (unpaid) to 2 (paid).

If an order is already paid or cancelled, the API call will return an error response stating that.


Complete Order Response
_______________________

Complete Order changes the :code:`"paymentStatus"` field to 2 (paid), :code:`"status"` field to 20 (complete) and the :code:`"statusText"` field to "Complete" regardless of the values within the fields beforehand except for the condition(s) below.

If an order is already complete or cancelled, the API call will return an error response stating that.


Cancel Order Response
_______________________

Cancel Order changes the :code:`"status"` field to 30 (cancelled) and the :code:`"statusText"` field to "Cancelled". This action will cause the order to be inaccessible to the other 3 API calls and **cannot be reversed**.

If an order is already cancelled, the API call will return an error response stating that.

These are various examples of the error responses returned by failed API calls described above:
