    }


Example of API call request using cURL (JSON). To avoid HTTP 100 Continue, please specify "Expect:" as a header.

.. code-block:: bash

    $ curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -H "Authorization: token vE53k50FVtct50ll8iHBE6FgMRVCyJeF" -H "Expect:" https://orders.upnormal.co.id/api/store/orders/cancel -i -d '{ "order": "FR9TL74P" }'
    
Response
----------

In response to these API calls, Omni will reply with the following data in JSON:

=================== ==================
Variable            Description
=================== ==================
id                  Order ID
number              Order number string
total               Total value before tax, service charge, delivery fee, discount and promotion
tax                 Tax value
serviceCharge       Service charge
grandTotal          Total value after tax, service charge, delivery fee, discount and promotion
tableNumber         Table number string
channel             An int representing where order was created (Mobile App, POS, Kiosk, Web)
notes               Customer notes string (example: no lettuce)
status              An int representing the order status ID
deliveryStatus      An int representing the delivery status ID
statusText          Order status string
storeName           Store name string
userID              ID of user making the order
created             Time when order is created in UNIX time
paymentMethod       An int representing the payment method ID
paymentStatus       An int representing the payment status ID
user                Contains the user's id, name and phone number

=================== ==================

An example of the response in JSON is found `here`_.

Cancel Order changes the :code:`"status"` field to 30 (cancelled) and the :code:`"statusText"` field to "Cancelled". This action will cause the order to be inaccessible to the other 3 API calls and **cannot be reversed**.

If an order is already cancelled, the API call will return an error response stating that.
